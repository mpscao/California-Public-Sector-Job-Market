This repository contains the coding projects I had done for the California Public Sector Job Market. Unfortunately, I am unable to upload the datasets that I imported information from due to privacy reasons. The coding was done in R or Python via Jupyter Notebook.
As a general summary, I cleaned and merged together datasets containing application and hiring information for California public sector jobs, created a new variable that classified each job
by its overarching category, and created graphs that analyzed the trends in STEM and health jobs, as well as the impact of Covid-19 on engineering, nursing and remote jobs. 
I will continue to update this repository as I conduct more analysis.
